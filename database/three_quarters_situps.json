    "description": "Lie on the floor with your feet firmly placed on the floor or locked under something to get some help.\nKeep your knees bent throughout the training set and your hands placed on the side or behind your head. Start lying on your back and go up with your upper body just like a normal sit-up, when you turn in the top position you only go down about 3/4 of the movement path before you turn up again."
