    "description": "Lie on your left side with your head resting on your arm.\nBend your right knee and hip up toward your chest as far as you can, and let it drop to the floor.\nBend your left knee and grab your left foot (use a strap if you canâ€™t reach it) with your right hand.\nMake sure your leg and torso remain in a straight line as you gently bring your top shoulder blade toward the floor.\nFor more of a spinal twist, turn your head to look over your right shoulder."
