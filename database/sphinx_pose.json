    "description": "Lie on your stomach with your legs straight out behind you.\nPlace your elbows under your shoulders and your forearms on the floor as you lift your chest up off the floor.\nPress your hips and thighs into the floor, and think about lengthening your spine while keeping your shoulders relaxed.\nSit up just enough to feel a nice stretch in your lower back. Don't hyperextend, and stop immediately if you start to feel any discomfort or pain."
